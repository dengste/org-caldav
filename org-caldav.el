;;; Commentary:

;; Tested CalDAV servers: Owncloud, Google Calendar.
;;
;; IMPORTANT: Do NOT simply put your main calendar in `org-caldav-calendar-id'!
;;
;; Instead, create a new, dedicated calendar.  The code is still
;; pretty rough and might easily delete entries it should not delete.
;;
;; This package depends on the url-dav package, which unfortunately is
;; broken in Emacs proper. Get a fixed one from
;;   https://github.com/dengste/org-caldav
;; and load it before using org-caldav.
;;
;; In a nutshell:
;;
;; - Create a new calendar; the name does not matter. Again, do *not*
;;   use your precious main calendar.
;;
;; - Set `org-caldav-url' to the base address of your CalDAV server:
;;    * Owncloud: https://OWNCLOUD-SERVER-URL/remote.php/caldav/calendars/USERID
;;    * Google: https://www.google.com/calendar/dav
;;
;; - Set `org-caldav-calendar-id' to the calendar-id of your new calendar:
;;    * OwnCloud: Simply the name of the calendar.
;;    * Google: Click on 'calendar settings' and the id will be shown
;;      next to "Calendar Address". It is of the form
;;      ID@group.calendar.google.com. Do *not* omit the domain.
;;
;; - Set `org-caldav-files' to the list of org files you would like to
;;   sync. For everything else, you can use the org-icalendar-*
;;   variables, since org-caldav uses that package to generate the
;;   events.
;;
;; - Set `org-caldav-inbox' to an org filename where new entries from
;;   the calendar should be stored.
;;
;; Call `org-caldav-sync' to start the sync. The URL package will ask
;; you for username/password for accessing the calendar.
